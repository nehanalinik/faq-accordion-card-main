### What I learned

Challenge was with the accordion part indeed!! :)

First time using Sass Preprocessor!
Pretty daunting at first but its getting easy now with Sass.

### Continued development

I've got to learn more about background images in css!
Love to do more project like this, getting use to preprocessors.
